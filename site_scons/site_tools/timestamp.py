    Return a timestamp string for general use.

    This function returns a timestamp string in the format
    YYYY-MM-DD-ddd-HH:MM:SS.mmmmmmm+HH:MM.  If *dt* is not None, it should be a Python
    datetime.datetime object which will be formatted, otherwise, a datetime
    object is created by calling datetime.now().

    >>> dt = datetime.datetime(2002, 12, 25, 13, 45, 56, 123456, _DummyTZ())
    >>> get_timestamp(dt)
    '2002-12-25-Wed-13:45:56.123456+0000'

    The expected use will be to get a current time stamp, but this is hard to
    test.

    >>> ts0 = get_timestamp()
    >>> len(ts0)
    35
    >>> ts0[0:2], ts0[4], ts0[7]
    ('20', '-', '-')

    Uncomment this to see what time it is :->.

    # >>> ts0

    The TIMESTAMP_RE object in this module is a compiled regular expression that
    matches a timestamp string and groups it into 9 parts: year, month, date,
    day, hour, minute, second, microsecond, and UTC offset.

    >>> match = TIMESTAMP_RE.match(ts0)
    >>> len(match.groups())
